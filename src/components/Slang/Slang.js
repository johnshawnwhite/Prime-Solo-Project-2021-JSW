That SWEET POW POW / Pow / Powder/ —this is shorthand for extremely light and fluffy snow. Sometimes you can even look at the ground, blow, and snow will rise into the air, if this happens, grab your board, and RUN to the mountain. Also known as the finest substance on earth!
</p><p>
Ridin’/Cruisin’—Heading down the slopes, .
</p><p>
  SKIERS- Normally take up the entire run/ and or/ stand on top of features meant to jump off of. Similar to a Jellyfish :)!!
</p><p>
Shreddin’ the Gnar— Short for riding across the terrain. 
</p><p>
Steez—This simply means “style.” 
</p><p>
LIB_TECH—This translates to “cool.”
</p><p>
Knarley—Interchangeable with awesome, sick, rad, etc.
</p><p>
Hittin’—This entails going off anything where you could potentially perform a trick (a jump, rail, etc.)
</p><p>
Booter or kicker—Two entirely different style of jumps, one kicks you up high in the air right from the take off. (Booter)- you can hit as big or small as you want, assuming you have the correct amount of speed, as booters are usually built on top of a larger drop-off, in order to allow for maximum SEND-IT.

Yard Sale a.k.a Ragdoll —A really bad crash wherein some or all of your equipment is lost. Things are normally dispersed in different directions. Hat, snow goggles, board, etc. may be dispersed on the slope. Failing with style.
</p><p>
getting "shitwhipped"—A fall/wipe out that results in your body hitting whatever surface so hard, others can see your soul living your body.
</p><p>
Chatter—When your snowboard jitters and shakes as a result of the terrain. Basically when you land a massive jump anywhere on the mountain, and you ride across rough terrain, sure the fun part was the jump. But then you stomp the landing, and hold on for dear life! 
</p><p>
Gaper—Think  "The Lonely Island:)" A wannabe that’s new to the mountain that gazes, slack-jawed, at the terrain or at really routine tricks. Someone that’s out of their element
